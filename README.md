2BOS- Two Birds One Stone is an IoT based project to solve the two main problems of Starvation and Cleanliness in the Developing Countries.

This is a IoT based System that will accept garbage as an input and then distribute tokens based on it.

Two of the Major problems in the developing countries is Starvation and lack of Cleanliness. There are a lot of beggars on the streets who cannot even have their
day's meal. But a lot of people deny to help them by giving them money as they think that these beggars will not use this money for food, but instead will use the
money to get some alcohol or illegal substances for their addiction. 

Hence, we have developed a system that will accept garbage and then give them a token which they can use at some pre-described places to get food or clothes 
in return of these tokens. because of this, they can get the food from the tokens and the worry of them buying alcohol or something is ruled out because of this system.

We have also implemented a Cloud System that will monitor the amount of tokens distributed for further calculations. We have also implemented a system that will monitor
the status of the garbage bin and automatically alert the authorities when the garbage bin is nearly full.

In the next version of this system, we are going to implement object detection algorithms to base the cost of the token based on the type of garbage that the person
puts inside the system and also monitor and collect the data from these systems.
